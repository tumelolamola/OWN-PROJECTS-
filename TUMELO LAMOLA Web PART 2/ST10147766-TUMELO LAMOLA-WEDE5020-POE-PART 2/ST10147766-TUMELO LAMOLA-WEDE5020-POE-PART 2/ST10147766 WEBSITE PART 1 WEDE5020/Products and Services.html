        <h1 align="center">Products and Services</h1>
           <p>Our services consist of two types of effective assemblies which is CHIP-ON-BOARD and MULTI-CHIP MODULE
            CHIP-ON-BOARD ASSEMBLY	
            This is a new packaging method far different from the surface mount device (SMD) package technology. 
            The chip on board (COB) assembly offers more advantages and this package can be found in the smallest of all electronic devices.
             A chip on board is a bare chip mounted directly on the printed circuit board (PCB). A ball of plastic covers the chip to create 
             a connection, only after the wires have connected. In addition, the technician wires the bare chip to the board and uses epoxy
             resin to pour it into it. The chip on board follows three steps to make a chip which include, die mount, wire bonding, and 
             encapsulation of the wires and dies.</p>
             <br>

           <h2> THE BENEFITS OF CHIP ON BOARD:</h2>
            <li>Enhanced protection against reverse-engineering</li>	
            <li>Less costs</li>
            <li>Minimized interconnection resistance and length</li>
            <li>Improved performance </li>
            <li>Reliability because of heat distribution</li>
            <li>Minimized space requirements</li>
            <li>Shorter time to market</li>
            <li>Small number of solder joint</li>
            <li>Less weight on the circuit</li>
          
            <br>
            <h2>MULTI-CHIP MODULE</h2>
            <p>This is an electronic package consisting of multiple integrated circuits assembled into a single device that allows one multi-chip 
                module to host more combined circuits. Components of multi-chip-module (MCM) are mounted on a substrate, and wire bonding, tape bonding,
                or flip-chip bonding are used to connect the bare dies of the substrate. The MCM is mounted on the printed circuit board, and it can be 
                encapsulated by a plastic molding. </p>
                <br>
            <h2>THE BENEFITS OF MULTI-CHIP MODULE</h2>
            <li>Offers better performance</li>
            <li>Lower power supply inductance</li>
            <li>Lower off-chip driver power</li>
            <li>Reduced size</li>
            <li>Low-cost silicon sweep</li>
            <li>Helps in the integration of different semiconductor technologies</li>
            <li>Reduced complexity</li>
            <li>Simplified design</li>
            <li>Less weight on the circuit</li>
            <br>

            <h2>The following are the areas in which 3D-PRINTED TECH will specialize in serving the customers and schools.</h2> 
            <p>Companies and their technicians will no longer have to assemble pc boards by painstaking means of soldering each component by hand. 
                Our company offers to print assembled pc boards because they save time, labor costs, and space is taken up by the circuits.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>We will also do the following:</h2>
            <li>Identifying Partner Schools:</li>
               <p> The first step for 3D-PRINTING TECH.SUPP is to identify partner schools and educational institutions in South Africa that would
                  benefit from integrating 3D printing technology into their curriculum. We collaborate with schools in underprivileged communities 
                  or those lacking access to advanced resources.</p>

            <li>Needs Assessment and Training:</li>
                <p>Once the partner schools are identified, our team conducts a needs assessment to understand their specific requirements,
                 resources, and existing capabilities. We offer training programs for teachers and staff to familiarize them with the fundamentals of
                 3D printing technology, including design software, hardware operation, and safety protocols.</p>
                 <br>
            <li>Curriculum Integration:</li>
               <p> To ensure effective integration of 3D printing technology into the education system, we work closely with partner schools to develop
                   curriculum modules that incorporate hands-on learning experiences using 3D printers. This includes designing age-appropriate projects 
                   and activities that align with the national curriculum standards and encourage critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity.</p>
                <br>
            <li>Access to 3D Printing Technology and Resources:</li>
                <p>3D-PRINTING TECH.SUPP provides partner schools with 3D printers, filaments, and other necessary equipment to establish dedicated 3D 
                   printing labs or makerspaces within their premises. We guide schools in the selection and setup of equipment, ensuring they receive
                   ongoing technical support and maintenance assistance.</p>
                   <br>
            <li>Workshop and Outreach Programs:</li>
               <p> In addition to supporting partner schools, 3D-PRINTING TECH.SUPP also conducts workshops and outreach programs for students from a wider 
                  range of schools. These programs offer students hands-on experiences with 3D printing technology, fostering creativity, and igniting interest
                  in advanced manufacturing. We also collaborate with other NGOs or educational organizations to reach a greater number of learners.</p>
                  <br>
            <li>Mentorship and Project Collaborations:</li>
               <p> To further enhance the impact of 3D printing technology, 3D-PRINTING TECH.SUPP facilitates mentorship programs and project collaborations
                 between partner schools and industry professionals. This exposes learners to real-world applications of 3D printing, expands their horizons, 
                 and helps them build valuable skills and networks. </p>
