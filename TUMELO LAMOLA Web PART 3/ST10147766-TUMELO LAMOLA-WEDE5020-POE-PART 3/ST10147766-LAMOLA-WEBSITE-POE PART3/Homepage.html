           <p>3D-PRINTING & TECH.SUPP is known well known for offering their customers with the 3D printing business that is within technology and innovation. We utilize a wide range of technologies for electronic assemblies. Electronic assembly involves gathering, soldering, or integrating electronic components and circuits to perform one or more distinct functions. It manufactures electronic components and computer parts. In our company we ensure the practicality of a printed circuit board (PCB) which is part of the electronic gadgets.
            We also aim to Serve the current and future generations within the 3D printing organizations and empower learners and educators through the integration of 3D printing technology into education.

           <h1 align="center">About Our Company</h1>
        <P>Our work entails providing 3D printing services to companies and organizations and providing training, and fostering hands-on learning experiences, we aim to equip the next generation with critical skills required for the future job market. Our focus on underprivileged communities ensures that every learner, regardless of their background, has an equal opportunity to explore and benefit from 3D printing technology. We envision a future where every school has access to 3D printing resources, fostering a culture of innovation, and preparing learners for success in a rapidly evolving world. We utilize a wide range of technologies for electronic assemblies. A typical electronic assembly normally consists of the 3D printing machines that helps create multi-chip module and chip-on-board assembly. While the It Setup normally consists of computers, servers, network infrastructure consisting of a router and Wi-Fi backup package and telephony system. Basically, on the Tech side we upgrade the PCs old software to the fastest and most reliable ones.
            I chose this organisation because it is unique, and it offers a wide range of technologies for electronic assemblies that consist of Chip-On-Board and Multi-Chip Module. It also focuses on empowering learners and educators and offer customizable learning solutions that include, educational packages or bundles that include 3D printers, software, and materials tailored for educational settings.
